#summary A format specification for .reactorstate files

= Introduction =

= Details =

The `.reactorstate` files are meant to be dumped at each tick, so they represent the minimal amount of information necessary to describe the current timelines and active tokens in a reactor. They are still logged in an ascii format to ease portability.

Each line in the file is either a timeline description or a token description. A timeline is always followed by its constituent tokens. All fields are separated by tabs.

*Timeline format:*
{{{
[timeline key]\t[timeline name]\t['I'|'E']
}}}

*Token format:*
{{{
\t[token key]\t[token name]\t[start lower]\t[start upper]\t[end lower]\t[end upper]
}}}
