= Prerequisites =
TREX requires the EUROPA planning and scheduling library which is available through Google Code [http://code.google.com/p/europa-pso/ here]. The EUROPA build requires Perforce Jam 2.5 or better. Under linux this can be obtained thus:
{{{
sudo apt-get install jam
}}}
= Getting Required Sources =
These instructions assume TREX and EUROPA will be peer directories with a common parent which we shall call trex_europa.
{{{
mkdir trex_europa
cd trex_europa
}}}
Now check out EUROPA:
{{{
svn co http://europa-pso.googlecode.com/svn/PLASMA/trunk PLASMA
}}}
To check out TREX:
{{{
svn co http://trex-autonomy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk TREX
}}}
= Setting up the Environment =
The relevant environment variables are described [DevConfig here]. A *devConfig* file already includes these settings for your convenience.
{{{
source TREX/devConfig
}}}
= Building and Running the Test Harness =
TREX has an extensive test harness consisting of small examples which exercise a range of different behaviors in the executive. To build all relevant libraries and execute the tests, simply do:
{{{
cd TREX/agent/test
jam run-agent-module-tests
}}}
If successful, you should see the following command line complete without complaint.
{{{
ExecuteTarget RUN_agent-module-tests_g_rt
}}}
Inspection of the file *RUN_agent-module-tests_g_rt* should illustrate the set of tests that passed and will look something like this:
{{{
