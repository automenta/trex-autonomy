#summary Outline of tutorials which are intended to teach T-REX by incremental examples which you can try out. All tutorials assume the steps in the [GetStarted Getting Started] section have been completed successfully.

=Bare Essentials=
These  tutorials will get you working with the basic elements of T-REX.
 * [CreateProject Create a Project] - Creates and explores simple Hello World project.
 * [DemoTest Use the Test Harness] - Demonstrates running the test harness and illustrates its main components.
 * [DemoExecutionMonitor Visualize Execution] - Shows you how to visualize execution using [Tools#trexmonitor trexmonitor]. 
 * [DemoDebugFile Control Debug Output] - Illustrates the use of high-fidelity debugging for inspecting execution state.
=Multiple Reactors=
These tutorials will take your through the steps of building and running a slightly more elaborate example that demonstrates co-ordinated action across multiple timelines and multiple reactors.
 * A model for Rock, Paper, Scissors
 * Playing the game
 * Working with multiple reactors
 * Implementing a Tele-Reactor
=Basic Trouble-Shooting=
These tutorials will focus on using the Execution Monitor in conjunction with different debugging strategies to identify and debug problems.
 * How to use the Token Network Viewer
 * Detecting and fixing constraint violations
 * Detecting and fixing an over-constrained model
 * Detecting and fixing an under constrained model
=Design Patterns=
These tutorials will introduce you to common modeling approaches for modeling problem domains.
 * Using Agent Actions
 * Implementing a State Machine
 * Implementing an Iterators
 * Value Abstraction
 * Handling Timeouts
=Testing=
These tutorials will introduce different testing techniques you can use.
 * Capturing an event log
 * Validating against an event log
 * Specifying expected execution conditions
 * Building a NDDL simulator
=Advanced Topics=
These tutorials focus on more advanced techniques that involve a deeper knowledge of EUROPA.
 * Implementing a constraint
 * Using the orienteering solver
 * Configuring the standard EUROPA solver
