#summary PlanWorks is a defunct debugging tool in EUROPA
= Introduction =
PlanWorks is a GUI tool for debugging partial plans generated by EUROPA in a specific database. It allows a user to visually inspect the following features:
 * Tokens in a partial plan
 * Constraint networks
 * ...

== Usage in TREX ==
=== Enabling PlanWorks Output from TREX ===
{{{
DebugMessage::enableMatchingMsgs("","PlanWorks");
}}}

=== Disabling PlanWorks Output from TREX ===
{{{
DebugMessage::disableMatchingMsgs("","PlanWorks");
}}}

== PlanWorks Output ==
In the context of TREX, there exist many databases, so for each one, a separate log is created.

== Implementation in TREX ==
PlanWorks utilizes a EUROPA::SOLVERS::PlanWriter::PartialPlanWriter embedded in PLASMA to create output of the partial plans for debugging.

Inside of TREX::DbCore::HandleTickStart(), is the call:
{{{
TREX_INFO("PlanWorks", nameString() << m_assembly.exportToPlanWorks());
}}}
This calls TREX::Assembly::exportToPlanWorks(), which executes:
{{{
getPPW()->write();
}}}
Which writes out the data to disk from a TREX::DbWriter. The DbWriter fulfills the same function as the EUROPA::SOLVERS::PartialPlanWriter.
