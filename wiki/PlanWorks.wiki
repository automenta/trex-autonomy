#summary PlanWorks is a debugging tool in EUROPA

== Usage in TREX ==
=== Enabling PlanWorks Output from TREX ===
{{{
DebugMessage::enableMatchingMsgs("","PlanWorks");
}}}

=== Disabling PlanWorks Output from TREX ===
{{{
DebugMessage::disableMatchingMsgs("","PlanWorks");
}}}

== Implementation in TREX ==
PlanWorks utilizes a EUROPA::SOLVERS::PlanWriter::PartialPlanWriter embedded in PLASMA to create output of the partial plans for debugging.

Inside of TREX::DbCore::HandleTickStart(), is the call:
{{{
TREX_INFO("PlanWorks", nameString() << m_assembly.exportToPlanWorks());
}}}

Thus the assembly is serialized and output via the standard TREX debugging system at the beginning of each tick.
