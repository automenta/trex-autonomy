#summary  In this tutorial you will learn about the test harness structure put in place for testing the executive

*Prerequisites:* We assume you have completed the tutorial on [CreateProject creating a project].

=Test the demo project=
You can verify that the demo is working correctly by running a test case that is generated as part of a skeleton test harness for you:
{{{
roscd demo
make test
}}}
You should see output terminating with an indication of success such as:
{{{
[AGGREGATED TEST RESULTS SUMMARY]

PACKAGES: 
 * demo


SUMMARY
 * RESULT: SUCCESS
 * TESTS: 3
 * ERRORS: 0
 * FAILURES: 0
}}}

=Inspect test files=
The test harness includes a single executive test located in the test directory under test/demo. The nomenclature is standardised on <test-case-name>.test
{{{
roscd demo/test/demo
cat demo.test
}}}
The text displayed will be something like:
[http://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/trunk/stacks/trex/trex_core/trex_create_template/test/demo/demo.test]

The success criteria for the test are defined in the .valid file <test-case-name>.valid. The file demo.valid contains:
[http://code.ros.org/svn/wg-ros-pkg/trunk/stacks/trex/trex_core/trex_create_template/test/demo/demo.valid]

=Force test to fail=
