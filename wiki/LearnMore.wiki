[http://code.google.com/p/europa-pso/ EUROPA-2] is the technology that makes T-REX tick. It is a temporal planning library available as an open-source system from the NASA Ames Research Center. We use:
  * the nddl modeling language (pronounced 'noodle') to specify programs in T-REX. 
  * the temporal database to store run-time state for planning and execution.
  * the planner to compute actions for execution.

Things that make EUROPA really useful are:
  * explicit support for time.
  * able to handle concurrent actions.
  * able to handle durative actions.
  * built in support for reasoning about and managing resources.

Things that make T-REX special are:
  * direct exploitation of EUROPA technology in a natural way.
  * a method for decomposing robot behavior into modular controllers that can be assembled in a principled way.
  * a lightweight technology footprint.
