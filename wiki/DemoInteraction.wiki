#summary In this summary you will learn the basics of execution and visualization of trex incremetally and interactively.

*Prerequisities*: Successful completion of [DemoExecutionMonitor]

=Start trex for incremental execution=
We want to run the executive under tight user control. To do this, we simply start [Tools#trexrun trexrun] with console mode enabled. For maximum speed of execution (faster than real time), we will also use the *hyper* clock:
{{{
roscd demo
trexrun --console --hyper
}}}
You should see a console open up with the following output:
{{{
[ INFO] 1256917677.371804000: Starting signal handler
[ INFO] 1256917677.394803000: Registering trex_pr2 Schema
[ INFO] 1256917677.403303000: Registering trex_pr2 Schema
[ INFO] 1256917677.407401000: Executive created.

[ INFO] 1256917677.407533000: Finished creating executive
[ INFO] 1256917677.407608000: Running the executive in interactive mode.

At the start of tick 0, H for help.
> 
}}}
This indicates that the executive has been successfully loaded, but the clock has not yet advanced beyond the initial tick value of 1. Notice the command prompt. To display a help menu:
{{{
>h
}}}
Which will display the following help menu:
{{{
Interactive mode.
Options:
 Q :- Quit
 N :- Next
 G :- Goto <tick> e.g. g100
 R :- Reload Debug.cfg
 + :- Enable pattern e.g. '+Agent'
 - :- Disable pattern e.g. '-Agent'
 ! :- Disable all debug messages
 P :- Execute a db dump at the current tick
 PS :- Start dumping the db at each tick
 PE :- Stop dumping the db at each tick
 H :- Help
}}}
=Enable verbose visualization output=
In this tutorial we will use additional features of [TrexMonitor trexmonitor]. To support these features, we need to enable certain settings in the executive that are not set by default because they generate alot of data which can hamper performance for large systems. To enable verbose output we enable a [TrexDebugFile trex debug flag] as follows:
{{{
>+trex:monitor:verbose
}}}
Which will produce the confirmation message:
{{{
Enable pattern: trex:monitor:verbose
> 
}}}
=Start up trexmonitor=
To restart [TrexMonitor trexmonitor], open up a shell and:
{{{
roscd demo
trexmonitor --dir logs/latest
}}}

You should see the TREX Log Reader Control window front and center as shown below:

[http://trex-autonomy.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/trexmonitor.interactive_tick_0.png]

{{{
Arrange windows so that the Log Reader Control, Timeline, and executive console are all visible together.
}}}

Observe that there are no reactors in the background Timeline window, and no ticks are displayed. This is because no visualization data has been logged from the executive yet.

=Set up trexmonitor to track execution=
In this example we will configure [TrexMonitor trexmonitor] to track the execution fronter, defined by the latest tick:
{{{
select the LOG Reader Control window
click on the 'latest' tick control button
}}}
You can always switch back and forth between tracking the lastest state and moving through specific points in execution history.

No we will advance to the next tick and observe the updated state in the Timeline window.
{{{
switch to the trex console
}}}
Advance to the next tick:
{{{
>n
}}}
This will report:
{{{
At the start of tick 1, H for help.
> 
}}}

We now want to switch our attention to the client reactor window. Observe that the plan has not been created yet. The visible state remains tick 0 since the executive does not log data for vuisualization until th end of a tick.


Now advance again through the console:
{{{
>n
}}}

You will see an update to the client reactor window as shown below:

=Visualize the token properties=
One of the things we would like to do is inspect some details about the token. [TrexMonitor trexmonitor] has a *token properties* window available. To open it:
{{{
select the 'Hello' token in the Timeline window.
right-mouse click
select 'View token properties'
}}}

This will pop up the following window which illustrates all parameters associated with the token, and its model rules.
