#summary In this tutorial you will learn the basics of using the trexmonitor tool to visualize execution

*Prerequisites*: We assume you have successfully completed the tutorial for [DemoTest testing the demo project].

=Starting the trexmonitor=
By default, the executive created in the [CreateProject tutorial] is configured to log information suitable for visualization using the [TrexMonitor trexmonitor]. Since you will already have run the *demo* test case, the log files are in place to visualize the executions you have already made. To see this:
{{{
roscd demo
trexmonitor --dir logs/latest
}}}
This will launch the trexmonitor application which includes multiple windows. 

=The Log Reader Control Window=
The first window of interest is the TREX Log Reader Control shown below:

This window is used to dictate where execution log data is sourced from. We started the execution monitor to point to the logs/latest subdirectory of the demo package. When first launched, the reader is at the last tick of execution. Tick controllers are located at the bottom of this window, permitting:
 * Skipping to the beginning of execution
 * Skipping backwards 1 tick
 * Advancing to a specific tick
 * Skipping forward 1 tick
 * Skipping to the current point of execution
 * Keeping up with the latest point of execution

To return to the initial state, click on the left-most tick control icon. Observe that the tick value becomes 0.0.

=The Timelines Window=
Select the TREX Log Reader Control window and drag it out of the way to reveal a second window titled 'TREX Timelines' as shown below:
