#summary In this tutorial you will learn the basics of using the trexmonitor tool to visualize execution

*Prerequisites*: We assume you have successfully completed the tutorial for [DemoTest testing the demo project].

=Starting the trexmonitor=
By default, the executive created in the [CreateProject tutorial] is configured to log information suitable for visualization using the [TrexMonitor trexmonitor]. Since you will already have run the *demo* test case, the log files are in place to visualize the executions you have already made. To see this:
{{{
roscd demo
trexmonitor --dir logs/latest
}}}
This will launch the trexmonitor application which includes multiple windows. The first window of interest is the TREX Log Reader Control shown below:

Select this window and drag it out of the way to reveal a second window titled 'TREX Timelines':
