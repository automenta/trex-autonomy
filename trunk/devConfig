# This file is a strawman for setting environment variables. It assumes TREX and PLASMA are peers in the directory tree.
# 1. TREX - which should point to the TREX root directory
# 2. PLASMA_HOME - which should point to the PLASMA root directory
# 3. TREX_LOG_DIR - which should point to the location for outputting log files generated by the agent. It is not mandatory
# 4. LD_LIBRARY_PATH - required for loading shared libraries from PLASMA and TREX 
# 5. PYTHONPATH - required to run the rex pythin tools
